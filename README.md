# 🐰 V0r-T3x 👾

Hey there! I'm V0r-T3x, an amateur hobbyist and jack-of-all-trades developer exploring the exciting world of technology and open-source projects.  

### 🚀 About Me  
- **🎮 Creator of Fancygotchi:** My flagship project and proudest accomplishment—a revamped pwnagotchi plugin featuring custom UIs, tools, and community-centric enhancements.  
- **🖥️ Display & UI Enthusiast:** Gained solid experience working with displays and user interfaces on single-board computers (SBCs) like Raspberry Pi.  
- **💡 Full-Stack Tinkerer:** As a solo player in the game, I’ve naturally become a full-stack developer to bring my ideas to life.  

### 🛠️ Current Focus  
- Improving Fancygotchi and expanding its features.  
- Experimenting with displays, SBCs, and hardware integrations.  
- Building tools and sharing knowledge within the pwnagotchi and open-source communities.
